# Major_project
(This is my major project in bachelors of engineering.)

   It is an android application where user gets to log in account and add friends. The user gets to chat with their friends along with the location information of their friends through GPS in Android phone. 
  This application has been hosted in parse.com. Since parse will be removed in few months efforts are being put to transfer it to another cloud server
